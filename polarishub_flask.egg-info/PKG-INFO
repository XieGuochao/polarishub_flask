        ## What is PolarisHub
        
        PolarisHub is a **free, fast, easy, secure** file transfer tool. The current version is based on *Flask (Python)*, which can be deployed on all computers with *Python*. With the command *phub*, the **PolarisHub** will start, and you can manage your **PolarisHub** with *GUI of web browser* (url: *http://localhost:5000/*). You can share your files using *url links* and *QR Code*, whoever in the same network can access your shared files. You can also gracefully shutdown **PolarisHub** with one click! 
        
        ## How to install PolarisHub
        
        ### Install with *pip* (Recommended)
        
        1. Make sure you have the *Python3* and *pip* properly installed.
        2. Run `$ pip install polarishub_flask` or `$ pip install polarishub_flask==X.X.X` (version code).
        3. Done! 
        
        ### Download the source code
        
        1. `git clone https://github.com/XieGuochao/polarishub_flask.git`
        
        ## How to run PolarisHub
        
        ### Run with *pip* installation (Recommended)
        
        1. `$ phub` (Run `$ phub -h` for more information on the optional arguments)
        
        ### Run with source code

        ## The advantages of PolarisHub
        
        (May use a graph)
        
        ### Compared with *OneDrive*, *iCloud*, or similar cloud file storage
        
        1. **Fast**. Taking the advantage of LAN with almost unlimited bandwidth, the file transfer using **PolarisHub** can reach the speed limit of the network, i.e. X MB/s ~ XX MB/s. 
        2. **Private**. **PolarisHub** is a decentralized platform, which originally does not provide a cloud center. Therefore, you own the **100% authority** of your files, and no one can perceive your transfer on the application layer.
        3. **Secure**. **PolarisHub** is an open-source project, where everyone can contribute to fix the potential bugs and there will not be privacy compromise problem.
        
        ### Compared with *WeChat*
        1. **Unlimited size of files**. We are no longer worried about the size of our files, which is restricted by *WeChat*.
        2. **Fast**. The same as indicated above.
        
        ### Compared with *AirDrop*
        1. **Free**. No limitation of the Apple hardware, we are building a software that every computer can use!
        2. **Longer Distance**. As long as the transfer is within a LAN, it can even be done between *the upper campus and the lower campus* and across every classroom and building!
        
        ### Other advantages
        1. **Easy Deployment**. **PolarisHub** can be deployed on every computer installed with *Python* using *pip*. There is no compilation requirement for it.
        
        ## The inspiration of PolarisHub
        
        The inspiration of PolarisHub comes from the annoying experience of using the current file transfer tools, as discussed above. Therefore, we are trying to build a software which overcomes all the disadvantages of other tools, a **free, fast, easy, secure** tool.
        
        ## Future plan
        
        We welcome everyone who is interested in **PolarisHub** to join us: **Polaris Studio**! You can find us on GitHub *https://github.com/XieGuochao/polarishub_flask* or send email to *st_polarisstudio@link.cuhk.edu.cn*.
        
        1. **Go Version**. We are going to refactor **PolarisHub** in *Golang*, which can be compiled and deployed to every platform without *Python*.
        2. **Public Server for host consultation**. We are going to build a public server such that everyone can share their file links (in local network) on it.
        3. **More powerful PolarisHub**. More features will be added, such as *access password*, and etc..
